# Windows-XP-Activation-Prank

Just download and run "activation_prank-xp.exe" on a Windows XP computer, log out, and wait for your friend to come back and log in.
They WILL be horrified. Remember not to do this to people who may not take it well.
To remove, just go to Start Menu -> All Programs -> Startup and delete "sp4exec" and the prompts will disappear.
